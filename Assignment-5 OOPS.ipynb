    "The following are the five main ideas of object-oriented programming, or OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This concept entails combining methods (functions) that manipulate data with attributes to form a single unit known as an object. It facilitates modularity and simplifies the object by limiting direct access to some of its components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction aims to reveal only the elements that are absolutely necessary, while concealing the intricate intricacies of a system's implementation. As a result, people can engage with objects at a high level without having to comprehend all of their intricate workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A new class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods (behaviors) from an existing class (superclass) thanks to the idea of inheritance. Inheritance creates a hierarchical link between classes and encourages code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: This property allows objects of distinct classes to be handled as if they were members of the same superclass. It permits the definition of methods in many ways, usually by way of overloading (several methods with the same name but different parameters) or overriding (a subclass with a specific implementation).\n",
    "5. Composition: Composition is the process of creating large items by assembling simpler ones, but it is sometimes regarded as a subset of encapsulation. One thing that contains or is made up of other objects is said to have a \"has-a\" relationship in this situation.\n"
